<html><body><p>Interfaces for managing open media files, including playback and synchronizationof multiple media files. Implementation is deferred so as to be as platform agnostic as possible.The default implementation uses QuickTime for Java, but a Java Media Frameworkimplementation is planned for future releases to support SignStream on Linux or Solaris (or, say, the Mac).<P>A {@link PlayerManager} instance is responsible for managing all {@link PlayerWindow} instances for a given SignStream document (SignStream can have multiple opendocuments). Each PlayerWindow handles a single media file.  <P>The PlayerManager instantiates different PlayerWindow classes on a per-file-type basis. The exact mechanism is still  up in the air, but will probably rely either on MIME-type info stored with the  media files or a properties file mapping file extensions to WindowPlayer classes.The "out-of-box" implementation needs only support one or two PlayerWindow classes to handle playback of all supported video and audio formats. <P>For implementations supporting multiple open media files, syncrhonization ofthe media files should be handled by the implementation, which may make useof native libraries for superior performance or threading issues. Sychronizationof the PlayerManager with other time-aware components in the application shouldrely on the {@link signstream.timing.TimeSlave} mechanism.@see signstream.gui.player.quicktime@see signstream.timing</body></html>
