/**
 * Defines methods for converting class instances to and from XML nodes, to 
 simplify serialization of data hierarchies to/from XML documents. 
 The interface uses Objects rather than specifying the spefific XML framework. 
 If the underlying implementation is changed, all classes will need to be 
 modified in order to serialize but they will still be compilable and so migration
 should be easier. 
 Currently the Object is an instance of org.jdom.Element.
