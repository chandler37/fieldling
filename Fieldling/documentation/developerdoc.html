 <H3>Developing Tools for Field Linguistics</H3>
<P>If you want to become a Tools for Field Linguistics
Developer, just follow these steps.</P>
<H4>I. Set up SourceForge</H4>
<P>1. Register with <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.<BR/>
2. E-mail a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fieldling">Tools
for Field Linguistics</a> administrator saying that you'd like to become
a developer.<BR/>
3. Set yourself up to access SourceForge's CVS server: 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=766&group_id=1">Windows</a> | 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=763&group_id=1">Unix/Mac OS X</a></P>
<P>The instructions for Windows users are particularly lengthy,
as several software tools need to be installed. Windows users,
as you proceed through the installation, please note the following:</P>
<P>1. WinZip or any other (un)zipping program can replace 7-Zip.<BR/>
2. Download a stable version of WinCvs (e.g. 
<span class="code">WinCvs120.zip</span>) rather
than a beta version.<BR/>
3. Once WinCvs is installed, you'll find it in your start menu under 'GNU'.<BR/>
</P>
<H4>II. Check out the Source Code</H4>
<P>
To check out the source code, you'll need to set your
<span class="code">CVSROOT</span> field as 
<span class="code">your_user_id@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fieldling</span>.
(In WinCvs, set <span class="code">CVSROOT</span> from the 
<span class="code">Admin - Preferences</span> menu option.)
And there is only one module you can check out: <span class="code">Fieldling</span>.
(In WinCvs, select <span class="code">Create - Checkout Module</span> and enter 
<span class="code">Fieldling</span> after <span class="code">module name</span>
</P>
<H4>III. Install Java</H4>
<P>Before going any further, make sure you've got
the Java Development Kit installed. If you're running
Mac OS X 10.1 or above, you've already got it.
Otherwise, visit <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>
to download the right kit for your operating system.</P>
<H4>IV. Install the Multimedia Libraries</H4>
QuillDriver uses QuickTime for Java, and also
(optionally) Java Media Framework. 
Again, Mac OS X 10.1+
users need not do anything; they've already got
QuickTime for Java. Windows users, however,
should <a href="http://apple.com/quicktime/download">download QuickTime</a>.
When you install it, make sure to choose a 'Custom' installation
and then click the 'Select All' box. Otherwise QuickTime but not
QuickTime for Java is installed. Get Java Media Framework from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/jmf/">JMF's home page</a>. If you're 
running Windows, make sure to download the 'Windows Performance Pack'
for best results.</P>
<H4>V. Build the Tools</H4>
<P>To actually build the tools, you'll have to install Ant, 
an application deployment tool for Java. Visit
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org/"</a>
to download the Ant binaries as a zip file.
After unzipping, click on index.html in the 
docs directory. Click on <span class="code">Manual</span> to get to 
the manual, and then proceed to the <span class="code">Installing Ant</span> 
section. If you're running Mac OS X, you might
want to skip the Ant installation instructions and visit 
<a href="http://paulr.dyndns.org/~paulr/ant/ant_install.html">this page</a>
instead. Or, if you've got fink on Mac OS X, you can
just type <span class="code">fink install ant</span>.
You won't learn anything this way but you may save time.</P>
<P>Note that before using Ant you must set or modify 
the <span class="code">ANT_HOME</span>, 
<span class="code">JAVA_HOME</span> and 
<span class="code">PATH</span> environment variables.
To do so on Windows NT, 2000, or XP, click on the 
'System' icon in the Windows Control Panel, and then 
select the 'Advanced' tab and then press the 
'Environment Variables' button. Earlier versions 
of Windows will require you to manually edit the 
Autoexec.bat file found in the root directory.
On Unix (bash), you'll need to use
<span class="code">export</span> statements to set
up the Ant environment. For example:
<span class="code">export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/ant</span>.
<P>The basic Ant installation allows you to run 
most targets. Note however that some QuillDriver 
targets use optional tasks that require external 
libraries. To run the full array of QuillDriver 
tasks, you will need to drop <span class="code">mail.jar</span> 
and <span class="code">NetComponents.jar</span> in Ant's 
lib directory (<span class="code">ANT_HOME\lib</span>). 
You can find the former at 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/</a>, 
and the latter at 
<a href="http://www.savarese.org/oro/downloads/">http://www.savarese.org/oro/downloads/</a>. 
Or, find these files by just typing their names in Google and then tracking them down.</P>
