This file documents meaningful changes to QuillDriver,
in reverse chronological order. If QuillDriver does
not behave as described here, or if you think we are
moving in the wrong direction, send us feedback.

chopped off and archived. Thanks!

   - Retrofitted to work with Roger Andersen et al's
     'Ucuchi Live and In Color' content. From the 'View'
     menu, select 'Ucuchi Live'. Then download sample
     content at
        <http://altiplano.emich.edu/quilldriver/Scene01.zip>
     
     This zip archive contains two files, a transcript
     and a video, which you can open in QuillDriver with
     'File-Open'.

   - Added a 'Help' menu which, among other things,
     allows users to view this file from within QuillDriver.
