ABOUT THE FILES ON THIS FOLDER

On the QuillDriver Tibetan installers:

System requirements:
- A Pentium processor-based PC or compatible computer
- At least 128MB of RAM
- Win 98/Me/2000/XP

The .nsi files in the "Fieldling\documentation\amontano" folder contain the NSIS scripts to produce installers for QuillDriver Tibetan. All files needed would be automatically found by the relative path names except for two additional files which should be downloaded separately. These are the installers for Quicktime and JRE. Simply modify PATH_TO_INSTALLERS, QUICKTIME_INSTALLER, and JRE_INSTALLER to point to the correct location on your computer. The installers includes Tibetan Machine Web which are assumed to be in "c:\windows\fonts". Use NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) to generate the installer.

Currently there are two .nsi files corresponding to the two types of installation: QDTib-AllInOne-Offline-Installer.nsi and QDTib-AllInOne-Online-Installer.nsi, which produce the installation files QDTib-AllInOne-Offline-Installer.exe and QDTib-AllInOne-Online-Installer.exe respectively. Both installers include the installation programs for QuickTime, the Java Runtime Environment, and Tibetan fonts. The installer verifies if each of these is already installed on the system and if it isn't it gets installed. Both installers associate QuillDriver Tibetan to the extension .qdt, which allows for the .qdt files to have an identifying icon, to be double-clicked for easy read-only opening, or right-clicked for easy edit-mode opening. The difference between the two installers is that the off-line installer includes all jar files needed to run the application. It is designed to be downloaded and then installed off-line. The on-line installer does not include any jar file (making it substantially smaller) and needs an internet connection to run QuillDriver Tibetan for the first time. Using JNLP technology, it will download from the server the latest jar files. When running QuillDriver Tibetan at later times no internet connection will be needed, although if one is present it will check for updates and automatically install them. Since Java Webstart (Sun's implementation of the JNLP technology) does not support passing arguments to the JNLP applications, which is needed for associating QuillDriver Tibetan to the .qdt extension, OpenJNLP (netx.jar) was used instead the more Standard Java Webstart. OpenJNLP is an open-source implementation of JNLP technology which does allow the passing of arguments to JNLP applications.

NSIS uses MBCS and does not support Unicode languages, because Windows 9x/ME don't support Unicode. If you choose Chinese for the installer language, in order for the script to display correctly check that you have installed the Windows support for that language, and check that the specified language is the default language for non-Unicode programs. You can check or set it in "Control Panel" -> "Regional and Language Options". Under the "Languages" tab and make sure "Install files for East Asian languages" is enabled. Under the "Advanced" tab, make sure that "Chinese (PRC)" is selected as the language for non-Unicode programs.

The file "InstallationMessages.xls" contains the messages in English and Chinese used in the installer. Here the Chinese messages are in Unicode. Nevertheless NSIS does not support Unicode, so in order to convert the messages into Chinese non-unicode paste them into BabelPad (http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelPad.html) and select "File" -> "Export..." and choose "GB18030" as encoding and save it as "InstallationMessages.txt". Then copy and paste the individual messages into their respective places in "QuillDriver.nsi". Remember to leave a return after "$\n\".
