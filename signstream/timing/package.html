<P>Interfaces for communication between different synchronized components.
  
<P>Note that these interfaces are not intended for synchronizing homogeneous
components like multiple video windows, as this is presumably best handled 
by the particular media player implementation. The timing interfaces are
useful in syncronizing the media player (which may provide multiple stream
 playback) with the {@link Sequencer} component. 

<P>Because the SignStream user can 
manipulate the current time in the sequencer, causing open video players
to update, or can play open video(s), causing the the sequencer to update,
the relationship between
these components is not a one-way master/slave relationship. Each component
is slaved to the other. Nor is this as simple as a mode, where one or the 
other component is the master at any given time. For example, the user should
be able to play the video(s), and click within the sequencer during playback 
causing the video to jump to a different time and continue playing. 

<P>The {@link TimeSlave} interface defines only the single method
{@link TimeSlave#timeChanged}, which notifies the implenting object that 
some slave with which it is linked has updated its own time. The 
{@link TimeSlaveHelper} exists for two reasons: all TimeSlave classes
must implement mostly identical behavior, including registering other slaves;
and some mechanism is needed to prevent infinite loops of slaves telling 
each other that their current time has changed, and this mechanism must be 
consistently implemented among the coordinated slaves. 

<P>Classes implementing TimeSlave should therefore delegate to a shared instance 
of TimeSlaveHelper, using the following implementation:

<pre><code>
public void timeChanged(int time) {
  // spawn a new thread if appropriate for complex rendering or other
  // operations; update component state and/or display
  this.currentTime = time; // or equivalent
  // other thread activity may have changed currentTime by now,
  // in which case we want to broadcast this
  timeSlaveHelper.broadcastTimeChanged(this.currentTime, this);
}
</code></pre>

<P>TimeSlaveHelper will not propogate sequential calls giving the same time
value, so it absorbs the recursive calls from other slaves. Likewise it will not
call timeChanged() on the initial caller, as it skips notifying 
the TimeSlave instance identified as the <code>source</code> parameter to
broadcastTimeChanged(). 

<P>This implementation allows TimeSlave classes to handle their 
current time by calling their own timeChanged() method, as when the user
performs a GUI operation to change the current time. The TimeSlaveHelper
implementation may be improved or otherwise changed in the future without
forcing any change to the TimeSlave implementors.
