  Deals with asset packages, which are collections of video, audio, and other
resource files that are the basis of transcripts. 

Asset packages address several issues related to media files, including:
<UL>
<LI>The need to relocate or reorganize media files while maintaining the links
from associated transcripts. 
<LI>The ability to exchange logically equivalent media files that use different
data formats. (E.g. different installations may have different restrictions on
file size, codecs; different users may have different needs for quality or framerate).
<LI>The ability to distribute transcripts independent of associated media, allowing
users to locate assets as needed.
<LI>The ability for members of a working group to share a centralized repository
of media files. 
</UL>

There are more cases but these examples give an idea of the problem. The designed
solution provides both globally unique organization of assets and a level of 
indirection in the association of transcripts and assets. Based on Sun's packaging
of Java code, a package is a logical collection with an identifying name. The name
corresponds to a directory path, where the path is relative to 
any number of known asset locations (similar to Java's classpath).

For example a transcript might reference the package "edu.bu.asllrp.2003.stories".
When loading the transcript, an application would look in known asset locations, 
typically including a locally mounted directory, for the path
edu/bu/asllrp/2003/stories. Within the package directory is a manifest document,
identifying the available assets files. The actual assets might reside in 
the same directory, somewhere else on a local or networked file system, 
an unmounted volume, etc. 

Within each package files are grouped into scenes, which are simply independent timelines. 
In the above example, the package might contain several named scenes, each 
corresponding to one or more videos comprising a single narrated story. So a transcript
is associated with a package ("edu.bu.asllrp.2003.stories"), a scene 
("Big dog story"), and a time slice relative to the scene 
(00:00:12.130 to 00:00:18.000).
In the case where a set of short transcripts are not related by time -- for example
a set of transcribed sentences related by a linguistic feature but taken from
many different video sources -- they may be arbitrarily grouped into a 
single scene and treated as if they were chronological. In other words, there is no
requirement to use multiple scenes unless a package must be divided into distinct
timelines.

A physical package directory need not reference all possible asset files belonging
to the logical package. For example one user may have a version of the "stories" 
package that references only compressed AVI files of 1-5 second duration, 
while another user's "stories" package references 20 minute, uncompressed MPEG-1 files. 
Each user has differing research goals and platform requirements so they need
different files, but both are using the same logical package and can exchange 
transcripts for the package easily.

In cases where a transcript refers to a package, scene, or time slice for 
which no assets are locally available, the application may prompt the user
to mount a CD or DVD, or send a request to a remote server to locate appropriate
assets. A package manifest can contain additional information like a source 
server URL, original volume name, etc.
