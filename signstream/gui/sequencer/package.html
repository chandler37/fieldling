<P>The central GUI component for viewing and editing SignStream transcripts. 

<P>Based loosely on {@link JTable} and {@link JTree}, the sequencer is a 
{@link JComponent} capable of displaying and editing multiple tracks of
timed annotations. The actual tracks and their data are held in a 
{@link SequencerModel}. Within this model, each track contains a list of
{@link TrackItem}s -- simple containers with start and end times, and an Object 
value of an arbitrary type. The type of this Object is homogeneous within 
a single track. 

<P>It is important to note that data types in the context of the sequencer are
not the same as data types in the context of SignStream's 
{@link signstream.scheme, Coding Schemes}. In the application, coding schemes'
data types are represented using custom sequencer data types as described below.

<P>The way data is typed and constrained is by contract, enforced
by implementations of {@link TrackEditor}. By implementing different 
TrackEditors and {@link TrackRenderer}s, many different
data types can be supported, including simple textual or numeric data, icons, 
special font- or glyph-based data, musical notation, etc. The commonality is that
the data is represented temporally in the horizontal axis.

<P>The {@link SequencerModel} and its each of its aggregate {@link SequencerTrack}s
have an associated <code>constraints</code> Object that has two basic purposes:
<OL>
<LI>Specific TrackEditors and TrackRenderers are registered globally at runtime 
with static methods of Sequencer. Each class is registered with a Class key,
and subsequently SequencerTracks whose <code>constraints</code> 
Object is an instance of this class automatically use the registered 
editor/renderer component for editing/rendering of that track's data. 
<LI>The editor or renderer is passed the <code>constraints</code> Object and
may use this to <i>constrain</i> the data being edited or displayed. 
</OL>

<P>An example may help illustrate. In the case of SignStream's coding scheme-based
transcripts (as opposed to, say, a musical score), all annotations for a given
transcription are contrained by a single {@link signstream.scheme, CodingScheme}.

At runtime, classes SchemedTrackEditor and 
SchemedTrackRenderer are registered (these are hypothetical examples for the 
sake of this illustration) by calling Sequencer.registerTrackEditor() and
Sequencer.registerTrackRenderer(), using the CodingScheme Class as the key. When
a transcript is opened, a new Sequencer is instantiated. 
A SequencerModel is first constructed with a {@link signstream.scheme.CodingScheme} 
instance as its <code>constraints</code> object. Within the model, each added
SequencerTrack is constructed with a {@link signstream.scheme.SchemeField} as
its <code>contraints</code> object. 

When the Sequencer renders the display,
